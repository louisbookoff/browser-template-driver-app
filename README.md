# Busie Operator Application-Client

This application allows operators to sign in and manage simple elements of trip data in the form of creating, reading, editing, and deleting trips they are booking on a daily basis.

## Getting Started

To get started with the client please for and clone this repo. From there you can go to config.js and set up a link to a local host or a deployed site and beginning editing or interacting with the application one you go through the proper deploy/set up steps

### Development Process
The development process was rather smooth for this application.  Although the application shifted from the initial design and goal due to project scope, I was still able to build something that could be useful deployed in an operational setting.  I leverage my initial sketches/wireframes to determine layout, varying slightly from those designs to insure the project scope requirements were met.  In the beginning of the development process I hit a wall while building the API, basically scrapping my first day's work to pursue a better version of the project scope.  Another area that monopolized a significant amount of time was incorproating handlebars into the application, as I avoided writing the code for it until one of the last days due to not knowing it very well.  I wanted to ensure that I understood it thoroughly before incorporating it into my application and am proud to say it is in this version and operating smoothly! Seeing my development from the first application I built to this one is incredible and I did not think I would be able to build a full stack application this soon (thanks to some Ruby magic). There were times throughout that I got side-tracked on little minute details like center the logo and different aspects of styling that I need to better at avoiding while in the meat of the development process. This is an application that I will use as foundation for future iterations and hope to see it being used sometime soon.

## Unsolved Issues/Future Iterations

* Each individual table column be editable to avoiding making user renter all trip information
* Add update trip modal form directly into handlebars to create better user experience
* Build out more professional looking pages with proper navigation and user messaging
* Want to add drivers resource and bus resource to create more inventory management system
